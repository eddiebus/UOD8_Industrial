  GalleryObjDesc: "Dear Jeanie, \n\nI know you'll never read this letter, the NDA
    means I can't tell anyone about what we're doing here, not even you. It's for
    myself that I'm writing this. I just needed to feel like I could talk to somebody
    about this, even if it's just a piece of paper I'm confiding in. Funny that I
    never saw the point in a diary until now, having seen what I've seen. \n\nThe
    things we're doing here, in this bunker, they're not ethical. The higher ups
    tell us that the experiment is of the highest priority for the American people.
    Apparently, this is our contingency plan, our last resort if the missiles are
    truly fired. \n\nAt first I understood, I could shovel away a thousand dead rats
    for such important endeavours, especially if it meant I could save someone like
    you. But now... I'm not so sure it's worth it. We've made no progress with the
    rats and small mammals, and apparently now we have permissions to test on larger
    subjects, monkeys and apes. It's unnecessary barbarism. I swear there was intelligence
    in that creature. I saw the light fade from her eyes. I don't know how much more
    I can stomach. \n\nIt pains me that you'll never know what changed me so much,
    Jeanie. \n\nYours, \nCarl."
